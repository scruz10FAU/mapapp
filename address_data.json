The official name is North Palm Beach Heights but most people just call it the Heights. The Heights is located off of Donald Ross Road and is between I-95 and Abacoa. The Heights neighborhood really loves Christmas and Florida Power and Light really loves the Heights. Every December the Heights shows their love of the holidays by decking out their homes with lights, inflatables, and all kinds of decorations. Some of the highlights are the lighted arches that stretch over the street and street nicknamed Candy Cane Lane because every house on the street is lined with colorful candy canes. My favorite decorations included the robotic arm sleigh flying the rooftop, tropical Santa taking a break from the Christmas madness by lounging out on his beach chair, the lighted flamingos which is so Florida, and all of the Star Wars inflatables because you can't confine Christmas to just this galaxy. Be sure not to miss Hollywood and Pompano Streets.",        "image_url": "/static/images/whovillerJup.jpg",
